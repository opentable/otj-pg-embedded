1.0.0
-----
* Stop excluding junit4 from testcontainers - check the README for the sordid details.
* Pass host and port to the ConnectionInfo bean. We strongly recommend you prefer getDatasource or getUrl, these will be more portable in usage. We ran into
a few use cases where this was handy, however.
* LegacySingleInstancePostgresExtension to do the old Junit5 lifecycle behavior.
* 60 seconds default startup wait.
* Expose bind mounts (optional, none by default) in builder, currently hard coded as Read only.
* Expose network (optional, none by default) in builder.

1.0.0RC2
-------
* Restore Java 8 compatibility
* Update to testcontainers 1.16.3

1.0.0RC1
-----
* A completely rewritten version of `otj-pg-embedded`. Uses "testcontainers" for docker, while preserving API compatibility.

Advantages

* multi arch (m1 etc) support
* Works the same way on every OS - Mac, Windows, Linux. Please note the maintainers only test on Mac Linux
* You need a tarball for every linux distribution as PG 10+ no longer ship a  "universal binary" for linux.
* Easy to switch docker image tag to upgrade versions.
* More maintainable and secure (you can pull docker images you trust, instead of trusting our tarballs)

Admittedly, a few disadvantages

* Slower than running a tarball
* A few compatibility drops and options have probably disappeared. Feel free to submit PRs
* Docker in Docker can be dodgy to get running.

(UncompressBundleDirectoryResolver ) which implements the PgDirectoryResolver interface.
  
  Eg:
  
  `EmbeddedPostgres pg = EmbeddedPostgres.builder().setPostgresBinaryDirectory(new File("/usr/local")).start();`
